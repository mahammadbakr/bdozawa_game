# 🎯 Cylinder Pickup System Setup Guide

## Overview
I've created a complete pickup system for your cylinder objects (SM_Cylinder2 through SM_Cylinder9) that will:
- ✅ Randomly place cylinders in the playground
- ✅ Show pickup icons when you're near them
- ✅ Allow pickup with E key or touch
- ✅ Display pickup confirmation messages
- ✅ Hide objects when picked up

## 🚀 Quick Setup Steps

### Step 1: Compile the C++ Code
1. Open your **Bdozawa** project in Unreal Editor
2. If you get build errors, click **"Yes"** to compile the C++ code
3. Wait for compilation to complete

### Step 2: Create Blueprint for CylinderPickup
1. In **Content Browser**, right-click in empty area
2. Select **Blueprint Class**
3. Search for **"CylinderPickup"** and select it
4. Name it `BP_CylinderPickup`
5. **Double-click** to open it
6. **Compile** and **Save** the Blueprint

### Step 3: Create Blueprint for CylinderPlacementSystem
1. In **Content Browser**, right-click in empty area
2. Select **Blueprint Class**
3. Search for **"CylinderPlacementSystem"** and select it
4. Name it `BP_CylinderPlacementSystem`
5. **Double-click** to open it
6. **Compile** and **Save** the Blueprint

### Step 4: Update Your Game Mode Blueprint
1. Open your existing Game Mode Blueprint (e.g., `BP_HideAndSeekGameMode`)
2. In the **Details** panel, look for **"Cylinders"** category
3. Set **Cylinder Placement System Class** to `BP_CylinderPlacementSystem`
4. **Compile** and **Save**

### Step 5: Configure the Placement System (Optional)
1. Open `BP_CylinderPlacementSystem`
2. In **Details** panel, adjust these settings:
   - **Number Of Cylinders**: `8` (for SM_Cylinder2 through SM_Cylinder9)
   - **Min Distance**: `500.0`
   - **Max Distance**: `2000.0`
   - **Min Height**: `50.0`
   - **Max Height**: `300.0`
3. **Compile** and **Save**

### Step 6: Set Up Input (If Not Already Done)
1. In **Content Browser**, go to **Input** folder
2. Create or open `IA_Pickup` Input Action
3. Set **Value Type** to **Digital (bool)**
4. In `IMC_Default`, add mapping:
   - **Action**: `IA_Pickup`
   - **Key**: `E`

### Step 7: Update Character Blueprint
1. Open your character Blueprint
2. In **Event Graph**, connect:
   - **Input Action Pickup** → **Do Pickup**
3. **Compile** and **Save**

## 🎮 How It Works

### Automatic Spawning
- When the game starts, the `CylinderPlacementSystem` automatically spawns
- It places 8 cylinders (SM_Cylinder2 through SM_Cylinder9) at random locations
- Each cylinder gets a unique name for identification

### Pickup Detection
- When you get near a cylinder, a **yellow hand icon** appears above it
- The icon shows **"Press E to Pick Up [CylinderName]!"**
- The pickup range is 150 units (adjustable)

### Pickup Process
- Press **E** when near a cylinder to pick it up
- The cylinder **disappears** completely
- A **green success message** appears: **"🎯 SM_CylinderX picked up!"**
- The system tracks how many cylinders remain

### Visual Feedback
- **Blue debug spheres** show where cylinders were placed
- **Yellow pickup icons** appear when you're in range
- **Green debug spheres** mark where cylinders were picked up
- **On-screen messages** confirm all actions

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Cylinder Placement
- **NumberOfCylinders**: How many cylinders to spawn
- **MinDistance/MaxDistance**: Spawn radius from center
- **MinHeight/MaxHeight**: Height range for placement

### Pickup Behavior
- **PickupRange**: How close you need to be (default: 150 units)
- **Auto-hide**: Objects disappear completely when picked up
- **Visual feedback**: Icons, messages, and debug shapes

### Messages
- All messages are customizable in the C++ code
- Success messages include the cylinder name
- Error messages guide the player

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Cylinders Don't Spawn:
1. Check that `BP_CylinderPlacementSystem` is set in Game Mode
2. Verify the Game Mode Blueprint is being used
3. Look for console messages about spawning

### If Pickup Doesn't Work:
1. Ensure `IA_Pickup` Input Action is created and mapped to E
2. Check that character Blueprint has the pickup input connected
3. Verify you're close enough to the cylinder (within 150 units)

### If No Visual Feedback:
1. Check that debug rendering is enabled in the editor
2. Look for console logs with pickup events
3. Verify the character is overlapping with pickup spheres

## 📋 Console Commands for Testing

Open the console (`` ` `` key) and try:
- `showdebug ai` - Shows AI debug info
- `stat fps` - Shows performance stats
- `r.ScreenPercentage 50` - Reduces render quality for performance

## 🎯 Expected Results

When everything is working correctly, you should see:
1. **8 cylinders** spawn randomly around the playground when game starts
2. **Yellow hand icons** appear when you approach cylinders
3. **"Press E to Pick Up SM_CylinderX!"** messages
4. **Cylinders disappear** when you press E
5. **"🎯 SM_CylinderX picked up!"** confirmation messages
6. **Debug spheres** showing placement and pickup locations

## 🚀 Advanced Features

The system also includes:
- **Collision detection** to prevent overlapping spawns
- **Automatic cleanup** when objects are picked up
- **Blueprint events** for custom behavior
- **Extensible design** for adding more pickup types

Enjoy your new cylinder pickup system! 🎮
