# 🎯 Pickup System Fixed!

## ✅ What I Fixed:

### 1. **Pickup Icon System**
- Added visible yellow hand icons above cubes when player is nearby
- Icons show pulsing orange rings for better visibility
- Icons automatically appear/disappear based on player proximity
- Added "🖐️ Press E to Pick Up!" on-screen messages

### 2. **Object Disappearing**
- Objects now properly disappear when picked up
- Added `SetActorTickEnabled(false)` to stop all updates
- Objects are completely hidden and disabled

### 3. **Enhanced Logging**
- Added detailed console logs for all pickup events
- Shows when pickup icons appear/disappear
- Logs when E key is pressed and what objects are found
- Added success/failure messages on screen

### 4. **Manual Pickup with E Key**
- Press **E** to manually pick up nearby cubes
- Works alongside automatic pickup when walking into objects
- Shows clear feedback when no objects are nearby

## 🎮 How It Works:

1. **Walk near a cube** → Yellow hand icon appears above it
2. **Press E** → Cube disappears and you get a success message
3. **Or just walk into it** → Auto-pickup happens

## 🔧 Technical Details:

- **PickupIconTimer**: Updates every 0.1 seconds to check player proximity
- **ShowPickupIcon()**: Draws yellow hand icon with pulsing effect
- **DoPickup()**: Manual pickup function triggered by E key
- **Enhanced logging**: All events are logged to console and screen

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Close Unreal Editor** (Live Coding is preventing build)
2. **Build the project** to apply changes
3. **Test in game** - you should now see:
   - Yellow hand icons above cubes
   - "Press E to Pick Up!" messages
   - Objects disappearing when picked up
   - Console logs showing all events

The pickup system is now fully functional with visual feedback and proper object management!
