# Test Instructions - Cubes Should Now Be Visible!

## What I Fixed:
1. **Made cubes spawn closer to origin** (-500 to 500 units around 0,0,0)
2. **Added visual mesh** to the cubes (Engine/BasicShapes/Cube)
3. **Made cubes larger** (2x scale)
4. **Added debug spheres** to show where cubes spawn (blue spheres)
5. **Added debug spheres** when cubes are picked up (red spheres)

## What You Should See Now:
1. **Blue debug spheres** where cubes spawn (these will disappear after 10 seconds)
2. **Large white/gray cubes** at those locations
3. **Yellow text** on screen saying "Spawned 2 hide and seek cubes!"

## Test Steps:
1. **Compile the C++ code** in Visual Studio or let Unreal compile it
2. **Play the level**
3. **Look for blue spheres** - these show where cubes spawned
4. **Look for large white cubes** at those locations
5. **Walk close to the cubes** - they should disappear and show "Cube Picked Up!"

## If You Still Don't See Cubes:
1. **Check the Output Log** for any error messages
2. **Look for blue debug spheres** - these should be visible even if cubes aren't
3. **Try looking around the origin (0,0,0)** - cubes should be within 500 units of there
4. **Check if the cubes are spawning underground** - they should be at Z=200

## Quick Debug:
- **Blue spheres** = Where cubes spawned
- **Red spheres** = Where cubes were picked up
- **Large white cubes** = The actual hide and seek cubes

The cubes should now be much more visible and easier to find!
