# ðŸš¨ URGENT FIX: Game Mode Issue

## The Problem:
Your logs show: `LogLoad: Game class is 'BP_ThirdPersonGameMode_C'`

This means you're using the default Third Person Game Mode instead of our custom `ABdozawaGameMode` that has the cylinder pickup system!

## ðŸ”§ QUICK FIX (5 minutes):

### Step 1: Create Blueprint Game Mode
1. In **Content Browser**, right-click in empty area
2. Select **Blueprint Class**
3. Search for **"BdozawaGameMode"** (our custom C++ class)
4. Select it and name it `BP_BdozawaGameMode`
5. **Double-click** to open it

### Step 2: Configure the Blueprint
1. In the **Details** panel, look for these categories:
   - **Hide And Seek**:
     - Set **Cube Class** to `HideAndSeekCube`
     - Set **Number Of Cubes** to `2`
   - **Cylinders**:
     - Set **Cylinder Placement System Class** to `CylinderPlacementSystem`
2. **Compile** and **Save**

### Step 3: Set as Default Game Mode
1. Go to **Edit** â†’ **Project Settings**
2. In **Project Settings**, find **Maps & Modes**
3. Set **Default GameMode** to `BP_BdozawaGameMode` (NOT BP_ThirdPersonGameMode)
4. **Close** Project Settings
o
### Step 4: Test
1. **Play** the level
2. You should now see in the logs:
   - `LogLoad: Game class is 'BP_BdozawaGameMode_C'`
   - Messages about spawning cylinders
   - Blue debug spheres showing cylinder locations

## ðŸŽ¯ What You Should See:

### In Logs:
```
LogLoad: Game class is 'BP_BdozawaGameMode_C'
SpawnHideAndSeekCubes called!
Spawning Cylinder Placement System...
Placing 8 cylinders randomly...
ðŸŽ¯ Cylinder Placement System spawned!
```

### In Game:
- **Blue debug spheres** showing where cylinders were placed
- **Yellow pickup icons** when you approach cylinders
- **"Press E to Pick Up SM_CylinderX!"** messages

## ðŸš¨ If Still Not Working:

### Check Input Setup:
1. Go to **Content** â†’ **Input** folder
2. Make sure you have:
   - `IA_Pickup` Input Action
   - `IMC_Default` with E key mapped to `IA_Pickup`
3. In your Character Blueprint, connect **Input Action Pickup** â†’ **Do Pickup**

### Check Console:
1. Press **`` ` ``** (backtick) to open console
2. Type: `showdebug ai`
3. You should see debug information

## ðŸŽ® Expected Result:
After this fix, when you play the level:
1. **8 cylinders spawn** randomly around the playground
2. **Yellow hand icons** appear when you get close
3. **Press E** to pick up cylinders
4. **"ðŸŽ¯ SM_CylinderX picked up!"** messages appear

The key issue was using the wrong Game Mode. Our custom `ABdozawaGameMode` is what spawns the cylinder system!
